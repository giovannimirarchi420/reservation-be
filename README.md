A Spring Boot application for managing the reservation and booking of any type of resources within an organization. This system provides a RESTful API for managing resources, users, bookings, and notifications, with a focus on secure access through Keycloak integration.

> **Note:** This backend is part of a larger project available at [cloud-resource-reservation](https://github.com/giovannimirarchi420/cloud-resource-reservation), which includes the frontend, Keycloak configuration, and Docker Compose setup to run the complete system.

## üéØ Project Scope

This system enables organizations to:

- Manage any type of resources, which are configurable through resource types
- Track resource status (active, maintenance, unavailable)
- Allow users to book resources for specific time periods
- Prevent booking conflicts through time-slot validation
- Manage users and roles via Keycloak integration
- Send and manage notifications to users
- Support hierarchical resource structures with parent-child relationships
- Store and manage SSH public keys for accessing resources

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The application follows a standard Spring Boot architecture:

- **Controllers**: REST API endpoints
- **Services**: Business logic layer
- **Repositories**: Data access layer
- **Models**: Data entities
- **DTOs**: Data transfer objects
- **Configuration**: System configuration

## üîë Security

The application uses OAuth2/OpenID Connect authentication through Keycloak:

- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based authorization (ADMIN and USER roles)
- Fine-grained method-level security
- Development mode with simplified authentication

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 17+
- Maven
- Database (H2 for dev, PostgreSQL for test, Oracle for production)
- Keycloak server (optional for development)

### Configuration

The application has different configuration profiles:

- **dev**: Uses H2 in-memory database and mocked Keycloak service for quick local development
- **test**: Uses PostgreSQL and Keycloak, designed for running in Docker Compose environment
- **pro**: Uses Oracle database and requires a running Keycloak server for production deployment

Maven profiles are aligned with Spring profiles to ensure proper dependency management:

- **dev** (default): Includes H2 dependencies
- **test**: Includes PostgreSQL dependencies
- **pro**: Includes Oracle JDBC dependencies

#### Development Mode

For quick setup and testing on your local machine, use the `dev` profile:

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=dev -Pdev
```

#### Test Mode with Docker Compose

To run the application in a containerized environment with PostgreSQL and Keycloak, use the `test` profile. 
The Docker Compose project for running the entire stack is available at:

https://github.com/giovannimirarchi420/cloud-resource-reservation

Run with:

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=test -Ptest
```

#### Production Mode

For production deployment with Oracle database and Keycloak integration:

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=pro -Ppro
```

### Database

The application supports multiple databases based on profile:
- H2 in-memory database for development (`dev` profile)
- PostgreSQL for testing in Docker Compose (`test` profile)
- Oracle for production (`pro` profile)

Database migrations are handled automatically through Hibernate.

### Keycloak Setup

When using the Docker Compose setup from the [parent repository](https://github.com/giovannimirarchi420/cloud-resource-reservation), the Keycloak configuration is performed automatically with pre-configured realm, client, and roles.

If you're setting up Keycloak manually:

1. Install and run Keycloak server
2. Create a new realm called `resource-management`
3. Create a client called `resource-management-app`
4. Configure the client settings according to your environment
5. Create the required roles: `ADMIN` and `USER`

## üîå API Reference

### Authentication

All API endpoints (except for swagger documentation) require authentication. The application uses OAuth2 with JWT tokens from Keycloak.

### Common Response Format

Most endpoints return data in a standard format:

```json
{
  "success": true|false,
  "message": "Operation result message",
  "data": { ... } // Optional response data
}
```
