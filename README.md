# Cloud Resource Management System

A Spring Boot application for managing the reservation and booking of cloud/hardware resources within an organization. This system provides a RESTful API for managing resources, users, bookings, and notifications, with a focus on secure access through Keycloak integration.

## üéØ Project Scope

This system enables organizations to:

- Manage various types of resources (servers, GPUs, network equipment, etc.)
- Track resource status (active, maintenance, unavailable)
- Allow users to book resources for specific time periods
- Prevent booking conflicts through time-slot validation
- Manage users and roles via Keycloak integration
- Send and manage notifications to users

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The application follows a standard Spring Boot architecture:

- **Controllers**: REST API endpoints
- **Services**: Business logic layer
- **Repositories**: Data access layer
- **Models**: Data entities
- **DTOs**: Data transfer objects
- **Configuration**: System configuration

## üîë Security

The application uses OAuth2/OpenID Connect authentication through Keycloak:

- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based authorization (ADMIN and USER roles)
- Fine-grained method-level security
- Development mode with simplified authentication

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 17+
- Maven
- PostgreSQL (production) or H2 (development)
- Keycloak server (optional for development)

### Configuration

The application has different configuration profiles:

- **dev**: Uses H2 in-memory database and mocked Keycloak service
- **prod** (default): Uses PostgreSQL and requires a running Keycloak server

#### Development Mode

For quick setup and testing, use the `dev` profile:

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=dev
```

#### Production Mode

Create a `application-prod.yml` file with your specific configuration or update the existing `application.yml`:

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=prod
```

### Database

The application uses:
- H2 in-memory database for development
- PostgreSQL for production

Database migrations are handled automatically through Hibernate.

### Keycloak Setup

1. Install and run Keycloak server
2. Create a new realm called `resource-management`
3. Create a client called `resource-management-app`
4. Configure the client settings according to your environment
5. Create the required roles: `ADMIN` and `USER`

## üîå API Reference

### Authentication

All API endpoints (except for swagger documentation) require authentication. The application uses OAuth2 with JWT tokens from Keycloak.
